=================================

##Purpose
This is the official history of the DBC Chicago Shovel.  The shovel has a long and rich history, but we don't know it.  We just know the following rules.

##Getting Started

1.  The Keeper of the Shovel is responsible for the Shovel.
2.  The Shovel must always remain in the building.  
3.  The Shovel is passed on graduation day from the Keeper of the Shovel to the next Keeper, who must be a member of opposite sex of the next graduating cohort.
4.  The new Keeper of the Shovel will take a pic with their predecessor and attach it to this repo.  
5.  The Keeper of the Shovel must hide the shovel in DBC, and if anyone finds it, the keeper of the Shovel must give them a treat. Via Natalie, Coyotes 2014.
6.  The Keeper of the Shovel must visit Starbucks twice in one day once a week.  Via Simon, Salamanders 2014.
7.  The Keeper of the Shovel will maintain this repo.  This includes adding your rule to the list, your Shovel-passing pic to the repo and your name to the Contributions section below.  Via Jennie, Bobolinks 2014.
